# Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Overview

This app is both a traditional game of Rock, Paper, Scissors as well as an alternative game with an exciting twist. The user simply selects the version they would like to play, and chooses their fighter. The computer randomly selects it's fighter and a win, loss or draw is displayed! The game then allows the user to select a new game and wins persist across all games. [here](file:///Users/chaddegange/turing/module_1/projects/intention-timer/index.html).

## How Does It Work?

1) When the page loads, the user is presented with a New Activity header. Below that are 3 category buttons with hover states informing the user that they are clickable elements on the page. Below that is a user input field, fillable for setting a user defined goal. Lastly, there are a minutes and seconds input that again is user defined, accepts only 2 digits as well as limits the user to inputing no more than 60 seconds. At the bottom right, a Start Activity button is disabled until all fields above have been properly completed. If any fields are not properly completed, an error message pops up to guide the user to a correction.

2) When the user clicks the Start Activity button, they are taken to a timer view allowing them to hit a Start button and begin the activity. The button has a border color corresponding to the activity category they chose in the home view. Past activities are viewable on the right side of the screen.

3) When the user clicks the Start button, the time countdown begins. The Start button is disabled once it has been pressed.

4) When the timer finishes, the Start button displays a Complete message to the user and a Log Activity button is displayed.

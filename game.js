// When fighter is selected, program should recognize id that was clicked
// id should be stored in player instance
// computer should then generate a random selection
// id should be stored in player2 instances
// a winner should be determined
// win count in instance should be updated
// win count should then be added to localStorage
// have a button to reload page or a timeOut function to play new game
// when page reloads, wins should persist by being retrieved from storage


// game.js
